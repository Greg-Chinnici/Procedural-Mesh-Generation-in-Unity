# Procedural-Mesh-Generation-in-Unity
# inputs
- vertex count (min 3)
- min distance from vertex
- max distance from vertex

#rough idea
- have a arbitrairy center point
- create the vertexes with a random radius around that point (bounded by max in min input)
- connect the dots with lines
- fill in mesh
